        <h1>Tom P Bates' Sketch of Patricia Stealing an Emerald</h1>
        <h2>This is simply the greatest piece of media to grace this planet</h2>
        Why have you taken us all the way out to the desert, Patricia?<br>
        Oh ello lads, I just wanted a hand taking me new emerald back home<br>
        Where is it?<br>
        In there. We just have to steal it first<br>
        Particia! Stealing is Wrong<br>
        Fun though, isn't it?<br>
        <i>Drama Ensues</i><br>
        If you bumbling gaggle of fools take one more step, you'll have to contend with me, Martin, the Destroyer<br>
        Got it!<br>
        Ah I'm Useless! Your brother was right Martin. Stupid Martin! Stupid little Martin!<br>
        Easy there Martin, there appears to be some deeper personal issues at play here<br>
        Why don't you come back to the village with us?<br>
        Thank you lads, I really appreciate...<br>
        <i>Particia shuts the door</i><br>
        No witnesses chaps! Now why don't we go back to mine and have a plate of fondant fancies?<br>
        Fondant Fancies!<br>
