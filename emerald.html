        <h1>Tom P Bates' Sketch of Patricia</h1>
        <h2>This is simply the greatest piece of media to grace this planet</h2>
        Why have you taken us all the way out to the desert, Patricia?
        Oh ello lads, I just wanted a hand taking me new emerald back home
        Where is it?
        In there. We just have to steal it first
        Particia! Stealing is Wrong
        Fun though, isn't it?
        <i>Drama Ensues</i>
        If you bumbling gaggle of fools take one more step, you'll have to contend with me, Martin, the Destroyer
        Got it!
        Ah I'm Useless! Your brother was right Martin. Stupid Martin! Stupid little Martin!
        Easy there Martin, there appears to be some deeper personal issues at play here
        Why don't you come back to the village with us?
        Thank you lads, I really appreciate...
        <i>Particia shuts the door</i>
        No witnesses chaps! Now why don't we go back to mine and have a plate of fondant fancies?
        Fondant Fancies!
